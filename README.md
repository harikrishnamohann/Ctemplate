Here’s a structured and polished version of your README that keeps your original voice and intent intact, while making it clearer and easier to follow:

# CTemplate  
> _~ A minimal template for simple C projects_

**CTemplate** is a lightweight project structure designed to help organize small-to-medium C programs. It encourages the use of a **unity build system** and includes a few personal utility libraries:

- A simple `String` type implementation  
- An `Arena` allocator  
- Basic error handling mechanisms

This isn't an all-in-one C framework, but rather a personal toolkit that grows as needed.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── lib/               # Home for second-level APIs (libraries)
│   ├── arena.c        # Arena memory allocator
│   ├── err.c          # Error handling macros
│   └── strings.c      # String type and manipulation functions
├── makefile           # Compiles the project into the /target directory
├── README.md          # This file
├── src/               # Your project files go here
│   └── main.c
└── target/            # Compiled binaries live here
    └── debug
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use this template for your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harikrishnamohann/Ctemplate.git
mv Ctemplate <your-project-name>
```

Then, remove the Git history:

```bash
rm -rf <your-project-name>/.git
```

You're now ready to start coding!

---

## 🧠 How to Use the Libraries

To use any library from `lib/`, just include it in your `main.c` (or any other C file):

```c
#include "../lib/strings.c"

int main() {
    String s = str_init("hello world");
    return 0;
}
```

Each library has a **"How to use"** or **API manual** section at the top of the file. Refer to it for a quick overview of available functions and usage examples.

---

## 📌 Notes

- This template assumes a **unity build** — all source files are directly included in your entry point (e.g., `main.c`).
- Memory management is manual. Libraries like `strings.c` and `arena.c` allocate memory that **you must free**.
- You’re encouraged to extend or modify the template as per your needs.
